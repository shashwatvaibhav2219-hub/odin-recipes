<h2><strong><em>Description</em></strong></h2>
    <p>Pumpkin sausage pancakes combine the warm sweetness of pumpkin with the savory richness of sausage, creating a hearty, flavorful 
    breakfast. Light, fluffy, and perfectly spiced, these pancakes offer a 
    cozy autumn taste in every bite, ideal for chilly mornings or festive brunches.</p>

        <li>2 (8 count) packages fully cooked sausage patties, such as Jimmy DeanÂ®</li>
